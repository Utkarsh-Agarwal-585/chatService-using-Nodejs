# chatservice_using_NodeJS

Created a chat micro-services using gRPC in which the client and server (let's say “Alen” and “Bob”) chat with each other, Alen can talk to Bob and vice-versa.

#### To run the server

```
 node server.js
```

#### To run the client - Allen

```
  node Allen.js Allen
```

#### To run the client - Bob

```
  node bob.js Bob
